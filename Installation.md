# Dependencies #

AndroidProxy requires the twisted python package. Download instructions can be found [here](http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/Downloads).

# Running #

Once all the dependencies are installed simply run with "python main.py". On Linux you will have to use sudo to run the script because it needs to listen on port 53.
